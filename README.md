# My-Portfolio
This is where all of my projects go: old and new, beginner to professional.

# Welcome!
I am Kyoji-Aeris, and I am a game developer studied in University of the East Manila.

This repository is dedicated to all of my works in games that I have worked on, from scripts to small builds.

# Source Code
All of my scripts will be organized on which game it was included in.

# Releases
Every release comes with a game build with a date which was built.
